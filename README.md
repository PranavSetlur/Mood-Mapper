# Mood Mapper
Exploring the Emotional Landscape of Your Playlists
Mood Mapper is a music categorization project that employs machine learning algorithms to classify songs into seven moods: angry, chill, happy, instrumental, party, romance, and sad. The project involves labeling datasets and then training ML models on these datasets.

Users can input a Spotify playlist ID, and the code fetches the audio features of the songs in the playlists using the Spotipy Web API. The model then evaluates the playlist's overall mood, provides a visual breakdown of mood percentages, and outputs song names in each mood category.
